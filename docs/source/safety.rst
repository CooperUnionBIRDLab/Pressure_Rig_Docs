User Safety
=============
Before operating the Pressure Rig, review the following critical safety protocols to prevent equipment damage or personal injury.

Critical DOs
------------
* Press the E-stop immediately if the system malfunctions, exhibits unexpected behavior, or poses a risk.
* Power down the system or engage the E-stop before uploading firmware to the Raspberry Pi Pico.
* Disconnect the tank-filling mechanism prior to executing firmware updates or runtime operations.

Critical DON'Ts
---------------
* Do not inspect actuators or interact with electronics while the system is powered on or pressurized.
* Do not exceed 40 PSI in the tank unless explicitly required for a validated experiment.
* Stop pumping pressure into actuators if visible strain, deformation, or risk of rupture is observed.

Additional Notes
----------------
* Always verify connections and pressure ratings before initializing the system.
* Monitor the Pressure Rig continuously during experiments and maintain a clear path to the E-stop.
